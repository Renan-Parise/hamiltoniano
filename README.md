# Hamiltonian Circuit Repository

This repository contains implementations of the Hamiltonian circuit problem in both C and Python. The Hamiltonian circuit is a problem in graph theory that involves finding a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once.

## Included Scripts

1. `hamiltoniano.c`: This C program utilizes backtracking to find Hamiltonian cycles in a given graph.
2. `hamiltoniano-grafico.py`: This Python script employs brute force and visualization techniques using NetworkX and Matplotlib to find and visualize Hamiltonian circuits in a graph.

## Usage

Both scripts can be run independently. The C program requires a compiler such as GCC to compile and execute. The Python script requires Python along with the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
